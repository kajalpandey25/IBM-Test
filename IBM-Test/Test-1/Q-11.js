// Check the below given code, if there are any issues, fix them and explain the output

// const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

//   if (num % 2 === 0) {

//     acc.evens.push(num);

// The given code has a couple of issues. First, the initial accumulator value for the reduce() method is not provided, and secondly, the accumulator should be an object containing evens and odds properties. To fix these issues, we need to provide an initial accumulator value as an object with evens and odds properties set to empty arrays.

// Here's the corrected code with explanations:
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  // Check if the number is even
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    // Add the even number to the 'evens' array in the accumulator
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    // Add the odd number to the 'odds' array in the accumulator
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc; // Return the updated accumulator for the next iteration
}, { evens: [], odds: [] }); // Provide an initial accumulator value as an object

console.log(result);



// Explanation:

// numbers is an array containing the numbers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

// We use the reduce() method to loop through each element of the numbers array.

// The reduce() method takes a callback function with two arguments: the accumulator (acc) and the current element (num) being processed.

// The initial accumulator value is provided as an object { evens: [], odds: [] }. It contains two empty arrays: evens and odds.

// Inside the callback function, we check if the current number num is even or odd using the condition num % 2 === 0.

// If the number is even, we push it into the evens array in the accumulator (acc). If the number is odd, we push it into the odds array in the accumulator.

// After processing all elements of the numbers array, the reduce() method returns the final accumulator value.

// The result will be an object containing two arrays: evens and odds. The evens array will contain even numbers [2, 4], and the odds array will contain odd numbers [1, 3, 5].

// The output of console.log(result); will be:
// { evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }
