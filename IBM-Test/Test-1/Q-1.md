What are the differences between cookie, local storage and session storage?

Cookies, local storage, and session storage are three mechanisms used by web developers to store data on the client-side (i.e., within the user's browser). Each has its own specific use cases and characteristics. Let's explore the differences between them:

Cookies:

Cookies are small pieces of data stored in the user's browser by websites.
They were originally designed for server-side data storage but are now also used on the client-side.
Cookies are sent to the server with every HTTP request, which can increase the size of each request and potentially impact performance.
They have an expiration date, meaning they can be set to persist for a specific amount of time or be valid only for the current session (until the browser is closed).
Cookies have a limited size (usually 4KB), so they are best suited for storing small amounts of data.
Cookies can be used for various purposes, including session management, user preferences, tracking, and personalization.
Local Storage:

Local Storage is a part of the Web Storage API and provides a way to store key-value pairs in the user's browser.
It has a larger storage capacity compared to cookies (usually around 5-10 MB).
Data stored in local storage persists even after the browser is closed and is available across browser sessions.
Local storage is synchronous, meaning it can block the main thread, so developers need to be cautious when dealing with large amounts of data.
Local storage is primarily used for long-term storage of non-sensitive data, like user preferences, cache data, or any data that should be available between visits to the website.
Session Storage:

Session Storage, like Local Storage, is also part of the Web Storage API and stores data as key-value pairs.
However, unlike local storage, session storage data is available only for the duration of the current session. When the browser tab or window is closed, the session storage data is cleared.
Session storage is useful for storing temporary data that should be accessible across different pages within the same tab or window of the browser during a single browsing session.
It is isolated from other tabs or windows and can be thought of as a separate storage area for each session.
